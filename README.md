            1,
            "Kerem Oflu",
            12000.0)`

> Creating product

            "Cappadocia Poster",
            100.0,
            "A gift from my Cappadocia Trip",
            PRODUCTTYPE.TRAVEL,
            istanbulGiftShop) `
            
> Customer buys a product

`customer1.addReviewToProduct(product1, "Nice quality poster!", 5.0)
customer2.addReviewToProduct(product1, "I didn't like shipping delay.", 2.0)`

###### Product details
